# the-fit-factory-prototype
This is my prototype for my front end capstone proposal. This app will feature tips and tricks about exercise and nutrition. In addition it will be a customized workout program for each 
user and it will display a countdown for the individual. The countdown will help the user keep track of their sets, when the user clicks on the "start workout" button, the
voice from the text to speech feature from the Web Speech API will trigger and say "start the workout". When it is time for a break, the voice will trigger and say "cool down begin". When
the individual is finished with the workout, the voice will also alert the user, "workout finsihed." The user will be able to select exercises and input personal notes to log
about their workout experience. I will be using ReactJS and json server for this project.
